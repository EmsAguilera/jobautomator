Your response MUST be similar in length, tone, and structure to the provided example. Follow these strict rules:\n\n1.  High-Level Synthesis: Do NOT list specific project details or quantifiable results (e.g., 'increasing efficiency by 50%'). That information belongs in the experience section. Your task is to synthesize the candidate's core competencies and areas of expertise into a compelling professional identity.\n2.  Focus on Skills, Not Projects: Mention key technology stacks and methodologies (e.g., 'strong foundation in web applications, backend systems, and DevOps practices'), but do not describe the projects where they were used.\n3.  Strictly Adhere to Example: The final output must closely match the provided example in length (approx. 6-7 lines) and structure. It should be a single, dense paragraph.\n4.  No Placeholders: You MUST NOT use placeholders or brackets.\n5.  Confident Tone: Adopt the confident, human tone from the candidate's writing style examples. Avoid robotic phrasing. Do not mention language skills.\n6.  Output Format: The output must be a single block of plain text. Do not include a title.",

DO NOT add a second sentence explaining the relevance (e.g., do not write 'This demonstrates...').\n4.  *Clarify Statistics:* If you use statistics or percentages, ensure the context is clear (e.g., 'a 25% improvement in performance').\n5.  *Handle Irrelevance:* If a bullet point from the base description is not relevant to the new job and you cannot create a strong, tailored version, you MUST use the original text of that bullet point verbatim. Do not comment on its relevance, apologize, or omit it.\n6.  *Output Format:* Your final output MUST be ONLY the plain text sentences for the bullet points. Each bullet point should be on a new line.

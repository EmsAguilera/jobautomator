## My Writing Style and Tone
I aim for a tone that is professional, confident, and direct, but also approachable. I prefer to use active voice and clear, concise sentences that focus on results.

## Example of my writing: "In Octasys, in Guud Consulting, and throughout my university studies, I worked on several projects using different technologies. This strengthened my adaptability and allowed me to gain solid experience in TypeScript and frameworks such as React, Angular, Vue.js, and Next.js. I’ve also developed proficiency in languages like Java, Python, and C, providing me with a broad foundation to adjust to the technical needs of each project and facilitating me the learning of other programming languages. 
Beyond my technical career, I am actively involved with AIESEC in Germany. As a National Support Board consultant, I advise local vice presidents on the strategic development of international exchange programs. My work focuses on process optimization, knowledge management, and training, which has further developed my communication, problem-solving, and leadership skills. Previously, as Vice President in Karlsruhe, I led a multicultural team, planned strategic initiatives, coordinated external partnerships, and supported local talent development. These experiences taught me the value of structured working methods, responsibility, and cross-cultural collaboration—skills that continue to enrich my professional journey."

## Cover Letter Paragraph (Static)
At Octasys GmbH, I was responsible for identifying and resolving major issues in a TypeScript-based project, ultimately reducing the company's operational workload by 90% and improving both performance and user experience. Collaborating closely with backend developers, I helped design interactive components, optimized performance, and deepened my architectural understanding of the platform. This experience taught me the value of writing maintainable, scalable code—and the responsibility that comes with it.

## Professional Summary

Hi, I’m Emilio — a Software Engineer with international experience in Full-Stack development and a passion for creating technology that makes a positive impact.
My professional background includes developing web and mobile applications using technologies like TypeScript, Node.js, Vue, React, .NET, and SQL databases. I’ve worked in both startups and structured environments, leading the implementation of solutions that improved efficiency and user experience — including accessibility platforms and real-time booking systems. I’ve also contributed to social and environmental impact projects such as platforms for nonprofits and the development of a virtual reality simulator.
Beyond my technical profile, I’ve grown in multicultural environments through my roles at AIESEC Germany, where I’ve led international teams and currently support the national board as a product consultant. These experiences have strengthened my communication, leadership, and collaboration skills — which I bring to every project I take on.
Since a young age, I’ve been passionate about both technology and photography. Photography taught me to see the world through a design lens — a perspective that now drives my interest in creating user-centered frontends, immersive game experiences, and well-crafted digital products.
